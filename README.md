# Ray Tracing in a Weekend - Rust Implementation

![Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/images/img-1.21-book1-final.jpg)

This is an implementation of the popular "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" book by Peter Shirley, written in the Rust programming language. The project showcases the use of the Rust programming language in creating a basic ray tracing application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

What you need to run the application: 
- Rust
- Cargo, the Rust package manager

### Installing

Follow these steps to get the application running on your machine:

Clone the repository to your local machine
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/augustocolo/RayTracingRust.git
```
Navigate to the project directory
```shell
$ cd RayTracingRust
```
Build the application using Cargo
```shell
$ cargo build
```
Run the application
```shell
$ cargo run
```

The application will generate an image file named ```output.ppm``` in the root directory of the project.

## Acknowledgments

The "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" book by Peter Shirley is a great resource for anyone interested in learning the basics of computer graphics and ray tracing. The book is a quick and easy read, and this Rust implementation is a great way to see how the concepts presented in the book can be applied in practice.
